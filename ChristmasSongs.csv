Written by Irving Berlin. Bing Crosby's original 1942 version featured the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter's Orchestra. The song debuted in the 1942 film Holiday Inn (sung by Crosby), then appeared in the 1954 color film titled after the song.[4][602] The original was re-recorded in 1947 and it is still the best-selling Christmas single of all time in the U.S. (estimated at more than 50 million sold through the years), and appears on numerous holiday albums as well. Other charting recordings in 1942 were made by Gordon Jenkins (#16), Charlie Spivak (#20)[141] and Freddy Martin (#20).[603] Spivak and Martin recharted in 1945 both peaking at #16. Crosby made #1 again in 1945 and 1947 with his single. [6] Elvis Presley's 1957 cover of the song garnered controversy when Irving Berlin called for his version to be banned from radio airplay."
